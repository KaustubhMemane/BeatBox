**What can it do**
--------------
 - This sample shows how to implement an audio media app that work across multiple form factors and provide a consistent user experience on Android phones and tablets devices
 - Automatically pauses your music player when other audio starts playing and un-pauses it afterwards
 - Per-application volume, boost quiet apps
 - It can read the music from your SD card
 - It can show the album artwork or display default artwork
 - It shows notification to control music without unlocking the phone
 - It can list songs by album or by author or just list all songs
 - It can go forward and backward in the current playlist
 - On finishing a song it will move to the next song
 - And many more features  I am introducing in this app in future
